  * Pull Request 14: Fix bug with project description. PR submitted by Jiwoong.
  * Issue 9: Add `project info` command to README
  * Issue 10: Test against 5.1
  * Issue 11: `projects` command only shows 20 projects, no options to paginate. Issue submitted by weisjohn.
  * Issue 15: Don't need to `inspect` snippet content.

NOTE: Issue 11 brought about a change in the way projects and snippets are listed. `gitlab projects` and `gitlab snippets [PROJECT]` command results are now displayed in the system pager or `less` by default.  A new configuration called `display_results_in_pager` has been created for this purpose.  If you do not wish to have these command results output to the system pager, simply set the conifguration to `false`.
